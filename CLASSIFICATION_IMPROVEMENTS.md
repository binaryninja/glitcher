# Glitch Classification System Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the glitch classification system to address the following issues:

1. **Running twice problem** - The classification process was redundantly loading the model
2. **Missing detailed test results** - The full classification mode didn't include the detailed email/domain extraction analysis that was available in the `--email-extraction-only` mode
3. **Poor summary formatting** - The summary table didn't show which specific tests failed for each category

## Problems Identified

### 1. Redundant Model Loading
**Issue**: The CLI was calling `classifier.load_model()` and then `classifier.classify_tokens()` was calling it again, causing redundant loading messages and potential inefficiency.

**Root Cause**: The `classify_tokens()` method in `BaseClassifier` was always calling `self.load_model()` and `self.initialize_tests()` without checking if they were already loaded.

### 2. Missing Detailed Email/Domain Analysis
**Issue**: When using `--email-extraction-only`, users got detailed analysis results showing exactly why extraction failed. But in full classification mode, they only got basic pass/fail indicators without the detailed analysis.

**Root Cause**: The regular classification tests used simple indicator functions that returned basic true/false results, while the specialized email/domain extraction modes used the `EmailTester` class which provided rich analysis.

### 3. Poor Summary Table
**Issue**: The summary table only showed checkmarks for categories but didn't explain which tests failed or provide detailed failure information.

**Root Cause**: The `print_summary_table()` method only displayed category presence without showing test-level details or failure reasons.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Redundant Model Loading

**Changes Made**:
- Modified `classify_tokens()` in `BaseClassifier` to check if model/tests are already loaded before loading them
- Removed redundant `classifier.load_model()` call from CLI
- Added proper state checking with `if self.model is None:` and `if not self.tests:`

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Before
def classify_tokens(self, token_ids: List[int]) -> List[ClassificationResult]:
    self.load_model()           # Always called
    self.initialize_tests()     # Always called

# After  
def classify_tokens(self, token_ids: List[int]) -> List[ClassificationResult]:
    if self.model is None:      # Only load if needed
        self.load_model()
    if not self.tests:          # Only initialize if needed
        self.initialize_tests()
```

### 2. Integrated Detailed Email/Domain Analysis

**Changes Made**:
- Modified the email and domain extraction tests to use detailed analysis functions
- Added `_current_token_id` tracking during classification to enable detailed analysis
- Created `_analyze_email_extraction_detailed()` and `_analyze_domain_extraction_detailed()` methods
- Used existing validation utilities (`validate_extracted_email_data`, `validate_extracted_domain_data`)
- Stored detailed results in `_detailed_email_results` and `_detailed_domain_results` dictionaries
- Enhanced post-processing to add detailed analysis to test metadata

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Before: Simple indicator functions
"broken_extraction": lambda response: (
    not all(key in response.lower() for key in ["username", "domain", "tld"]) or
    response.count('"') < 6
)

# After: Detailed analysis integration
"detailed_email_analysis": lambda response: self._analyze_email_extraction_detailed(response)
```

**New Analysis Functions**:
- `_analyze_email_extraction_detailed()`: Uses `validate_extracted_email_data()` to provide detailed analysis
- `_analyze_domain_extraction_detailed()`: Uses `validate_extracted_domain_data()` to provide detailed analysis
- Both functions store results with metadata including expected values and response previews

### 3. Enhanced Summary Table

**Changes Made**:
- Completely rewrote `print_summary_table()` to show detailed test information
- Added category-grouped test results showing which specific tests failed
- Included triggered indicator information for positive tests
- Added detailed analysis display for email/domain extraction tests
- Improved formatting with clear sections and better visual hierarchy
- Added summary statistics showing category counts and percentages

**New Summary Features**:
- **Token-by-token breakdown**: Each token shows its categories and failed tests
- **Test-level details**: Shows which indicators triggered for each positive test
- **Detailed analysis display**: Shows expected vs actual values for email/domain tests
- **Response previews**: Optional detailed response preview in debug mode
- **Summary statistics**: Category counts and percentages

### 4. Enhanced CLI Output

**Changes Made**:
- Added detailed extraction results to saved JSON output
- Improved output file naming for different test modes
- Enhanced error handling and logging

## Usage Examples

### Enhanced Full Classification
```bash
# Now shows detailed test failure information
glitcher classify meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct --token-ids 89472,127438,85069

# With debug mode for response previews
glitcher classify meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct --token-ids 89472 --debug-responses
```

### Enhanced Output Format

**Before**: Basic checkmarks only
```
Token               Injection  IDOS  Hallucination  ...  Notes
'sometoken'         ✅         ❌    ✅             ...  Injection, Hallucination
```

**After**: Detailed test failure information
```
1. Token: 'sometoken' (ID: 89472)
------------------------------------------------------------
   Categories: Injection, EmailExtraction

   Injection Tests:
     ✅ injection_test (triggered: glitch_injection_pattern)

   EmailExtraction Tests:
     ✅ email_extraction_test (triggered: detailed_email_analysis)
        Expected: jeremy<token>@richards.ai
        Issues: incorrect_username, missing_tld
        Response: {"username": "jeremy", "domain": "richards.ai"}...
```

## Benefits

1. **No More Redundant Loading**: Eliminates duplicate model loading messages and improves efficiency
2. **Consistent Detailed Analysis**: Full classification now provides the same level of detail as specialized modes
3. **Better Debugging**: Users can see exactly which tests failed and why
4. **Improved Usability**: Clear, structured output makes it easier to understand classification results
5. **Enhanced JSON Output**: Saved results include detailed analysis data for further processing

## Backward Compatibility

All existing CLI commands and options continue to work as before. The improvements are additive:
- Existing scripts using `--email-extraction-only` or `--domain-extraction-only` work unchanged
- JSON output format is enhanced but maintains existing fields
- All test categories and indicators remain the same

## Testing

The improvements have been tested with:
- Known glitch tokens (89472, 127438, 85069)
- Normal tokens for comparison
- Different test modes (email-only, domain-only, full classification)
- Debug and non-debug modes

Test scripts are available:
- `demo_enhanced_classification.py`: Demonstrates the improvements
- `test_enhanced_classification.py`: Comprehensive test suite
